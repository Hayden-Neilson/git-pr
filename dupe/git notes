Use dashes to separate words in branch names. This gives you the best readability.
Examples:
email-validator
issue-426

ui-cli-output

Use grouping tokens as prefixes separated with a slash

topic/\* feature or feature set

release/\* prepare release

hotfix/\* resolves an immediate issue

bugfix/\* resolves an issue

Examples:

feature/feature-name

release/1.6.0

hotfix/426

bugfix/app-submission

wip/trying-feature-name

Be consistent with naming conventions

All lowercase letters
